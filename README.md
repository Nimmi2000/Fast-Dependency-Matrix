# FAST Integrated System Design

Welcome to the repository for the F.A.S.T. (Fieldlab Autonomous Sailing Technology) project, an initiative by Damen Group, a leading shipbuilder in the Netherlands. This project aims to explore the technology required to transform a conventional ship into a fully autonomous one. The challenge lies in ensuring that the technology is applicable across Damen's diverse range of vessels, from tug boats and yachts to naval warfare vessels.

The purpose of this project is to provide Damen with insights into the necessary components and systems, their interrelationships, and their applicability to different vessels. Special attention is given to identifying potential vulnerabilities in the system. To maintain a clear overview of the system architecture amidst a complex web of dependencies and links, we employ a Design Structure Matrix (DSM).

The DSM designed in this project is product-focused, emphasizing the signal flow between various components in the existing prototype vessel. This approach will assist Damen in applying the lessons learned from the F.A.S.T. project to their entire range of ships. The ultimate goal is to deliver a DSM that is applicable to the fieldlab vessel but can be easily extended to other ships, providing insights into the modularity of the autonomous system for the complete range of ships.
